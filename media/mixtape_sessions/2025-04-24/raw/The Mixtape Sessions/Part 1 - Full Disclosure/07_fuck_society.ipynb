    "> **First Testament Finale** — This cut closes the album’s “First Testament” arc: denunciation, exposure, and psychic warfare. Hawk’s battle cry “Fuck society” isn’t nihilism—it’s a refusal to comply with a system he deems fundamentally inverted.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Street Tent ↔ Star Tent** — The opening sample (musician vowing to live in a tent to keep playing) mirrors Hawk’s own ascetic vow: ditch material comforts, wield music as a liberation tool.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Matrix vs. Mission** — Lines about “matrix traps” and “higher vibrational beings incarnating down here” fold New‑Age cosmology into hardcore rap, culminating in the creed **“Reincarnated to Resist.”**  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Structure** — Alternates between rap stanzas and two spoken‑word monologues (self‑recorded rants). The breaks slow the BPM, letting listeners digest heavier claims before the next verbal barrage.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Target List** — Pedophilia, transhumanism, gender inversion, 3‑D prison—Hawk frames them as symptoms of one parasite culture. The repeated “fuck society” hook ties each grievance back to the same root.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Stage Visual Cue** — During the chorus, LED screens flash social‑media headlines about each “obvious” inversion while Hawk stands inside a chain‑link cage that shatters open on the final drop.  \n",
