    "**Album:** Full Disclosure 2020  \n",
    "**Performed by:** Hawk Eye The Rapper  \n",

    "> Blast back at niggas, before they get bigger  \n",

    "> **EverLight’s Rite — Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  \n",
    "> **Flag‑Plant Track** — “Monumental” is Hawk Eye’s mission‑statement etched in granite. Earlier songs vowed resistance; this one declares permanent occupation of the cultural high ground.  \n",
    "> **Weapon Hierarchy** — The hook touts three tiers of firepower: the **pencil** (word spell), the **missile/whistle**, and finally **“God on my side.”** Hawk prioritizes logos over lead, but keeps both barrels ready.  \n",
    "> **Mythic Trash‑Talk** — Lines such as “I didn’t battle the devil—that faggot got raped” push horror‑core bravado to shock listeners into recognizing who the real villains are. It’s exorcism by humiliation.  \n",
    "> **Structural Echo** — Two identically phrased bridges (“If you wanna die now, I can pencil you in…”) mirror a sinner’s two chances: repent or repeat the cycle. Live crowds can chant the bridge while the beat drops to half‑time.  \n",
    "> **Sound Design** — Expect thunder‑drone bass under cathedral bells; each bell hit aligns with “monumental,” turning the word into a sonic statue.  \n",
    "> **Live Visual Cue** — Stage LEDs render stone pillars crumbling into pixel dust every time Hawk says “blast back,” symbolizing systems collapsing under lyrical impact.  \n",
