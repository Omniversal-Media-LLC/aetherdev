    ">   \n",
    "> **Code‑Breaker’s Anthem** — “Swordfish” opens the album by framing rap as cyber‑warfare. The very first bar—*“I’m hacking the matrix with my stainless”*—merges street‑level grit with digital rebellion, telling listeners this project is equal parts **keyboard and katana**.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Max Spiers Connection** — By dedicating the song to conspiracy researcher Max Spiers, Hawk Eye signals that these bars operate on more than metaphor. Spiers spoke about ritual abuse and hidden power structures; Hawk picks up the torch, vowing *“No more deadheads with petty excuses for abuses.”*  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Structure & Cadence** — Four‑bar stanzas dominate, mirroring the 4‑line spacing required by Apple. Internally, the flow zig‑zags from aggressive **triplet punches** ( *“I’m not a slave / I’m unafraid”* ) to longer **compound runs** that feel like data‑dumps. This tension between staccato and overflow reinforces the “information‑leak” theme.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Symbolic Arsenal** — References to Cooper, Vietnam napalm, and Illuminati puppets expand the battlefield from cyberspace to historical warfare and spiritual insurgency. The line *“I flick my wrist, they lose themselves”* nods to hypnotic programming lore, while “dragon’s fire” foreshadows the album’s alchemical undertones.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Narrative Seeds** — The repeated refrain *“Full disclosure’s what I’m seeking”* plants the thesis for the whole record: dragging covert agendas into daylight. Tracks later in the album reprise this phrase almost like a mission status update.  \n",
