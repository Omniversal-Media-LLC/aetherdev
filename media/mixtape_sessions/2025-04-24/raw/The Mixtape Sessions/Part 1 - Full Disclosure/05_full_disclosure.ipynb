    "> Track: **Full Disclosure** — *Full Disclosure 2020*  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Album Manifesto** — The title track is the Rosetta Stone for the whole project. Hawk Eye directly instructs listeners to “get on Google and do some research,” breaking the fourth wall and turning the audience into co‑investigators.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Information vs. Incineration** — The metaphors volley between **fire** (dragon breath, volcano flow, match‑lit arson) and **exposure** (full disclosure, waking the sleepers). Heat becomes both weapon and spotlight.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Action‑Hero Pantheon** — Steven Seagal and Jean‑Claude Van Damme references recast Hawk as a 90s direct‑to‑video vigilante—swapping fists for verses. This frames the track as a verbal martial‑arts sequence.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Conspiracy Checklist** — 9‑11, fluoride, chemtrails, banking cabals—each gets a single‑line nod. Rather than deep dives, these serve as QR codes that push curious listeners down rabbit holes.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Community Call‑Up** — The back half shifts from condemnation to mobilization: *“We can fix this world together… Unite for a purpose bigger than the lies.”* This prefaces the final arc of the album, where tribe building overtakes outrage.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Live Cue** — During the “chemtrails” stanza, fog machines release vapor trails across the ceiling while projectors write the word **DISCLOSE** through them—turning stage tech into the very metaphor.  \n",
