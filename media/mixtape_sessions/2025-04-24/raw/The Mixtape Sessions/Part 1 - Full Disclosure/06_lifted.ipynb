    ">   \n",
    "> **Ascension Anthem** — “Lifted” is the album’s pivot from exposé to elevation. Hawk Eye declares he’s “done with it” (the matrix games) and literally lifts above cloud cover where “Illuminauts stand under it.”  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Hybrid Flow** — Verses whip between double‑time internal rhymes and spoken‑word philosophy, embodying the lyric “linguistic chess with battle raps.” The embedded Laura Eisenhower‑style monologue serves as a cosmic interlude, slowing the tempo before Hawk drops back into aggression.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Matrix vs. Organic Timeline** — The sampled discourse about artificial timelines vs. organic ascension reframes the whole track as a choice: ride Hawk’s dragon‑fire bars to higher reality, or stay trapped in AI distortion.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Weaponized Semantics** — Lines like “break your face with my semantics” make language itself the artillery—consistent with previous songs but here explicitly called out.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Live Visual Cue** — Mid‑song, freeze band lights; project a morphing grid that splits into two timelines (organic greens vs. glitching magenta). On the drop (“If I fail, this gets underwritten”), have the magenta side flicker out.  \n",
