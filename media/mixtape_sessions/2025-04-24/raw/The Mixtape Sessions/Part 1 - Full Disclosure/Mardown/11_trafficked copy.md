    "> **EverLight’s Rite — Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  \n",
    "> **The Red‑Pill Lament** — “Trafficked” is the record’s moral core, yanking the spotlight from cosmic warfare to tangible atrocity. Hawk Eye reins in the bravado and addresses child trafficking head‑on.  \n",
    "> **Four‑Line Gospel Hook** — The refrain (“Speak my poetry … potency of this shit is divine…”) repeats three times, mimicking a prayer and drilling urgency into clubgoers who might otherwise miss the message.  \n",
    "> **Call to Starseeds** — By urging “all you starseeds” to grow, Hawk positions awakening as a duty, not a pastime: enlightenment must translate to rescue missions.  \n",
    "> **Structural Pulse** — Verse blocks of 12–16 bars punctuated by the 8‑bar hook create a heartbeat: expose → reflect → rally. Live‑show idea: dim lights to a single spotlight during each hook to force heads‑down focus.  \n",
    "> **Risk Declaration** — Hawk acknowledges martyrdom (“When I’m rotting in my grave…”) which both honors fallen activists and prepares listeners for potential censorship of the track.  \n",
    "> **Stage Visual Cue** — Background screens flash missing‑child posters that dissolve into the album artwork each time Hawk chants “Let your focus be all on me.”  \n",
