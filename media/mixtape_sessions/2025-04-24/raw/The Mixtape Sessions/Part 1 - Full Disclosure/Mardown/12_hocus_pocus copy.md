    "**Album:** Full Disclosure 2020  \n",

    "> **EverLight’s Rite — Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  \n",
    "> **Spell‑Caster’s Manifesto** — After two rage‑driven tracks, “Hocus Pocus” shifts tone from vengeance to alchemy. Hawk Eye lifts the curtain on his “technology of verse,” framing rap as literal spellcraft.  \n",
    "> **Grey‑Path Wizardry** — By declaring himself “of the grey path,” Hawk rejects dualistic morality; magic is a neutral tool, its ethics defined by the wielder’s intent. That mirrors the album’s ethos: disclosure over dogma.  \n",
    "> **Potions & Prowess** — Internal rhymes (“potions / emotions / oceans”) mimic rising incantation cadences. The beat loops reversed chimes to evoke a ritual circle.  \n",
    "> **Pop‑Culture Sigils** — A quick Voldemort flex grounds esoteric claims in mainstream mythos, giving casual listeners a mnemonic anchor.  \n",
    "> **Live Visual Cue** — Stage lasers trace a sigil each time the hook says “hocus pocus,” then invert colors to show the spell “firing.”  \n",
