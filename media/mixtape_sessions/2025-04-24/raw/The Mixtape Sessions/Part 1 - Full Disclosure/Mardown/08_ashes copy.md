    "> *Vibe‑Shift Chapter* — “Ashes” detonates the album’s tonal pivot. The earlier tracks threatened disclosure; this one promises retribution. Hawk Eye sits “in the ashes of a world dedicated to killing all activists,” announcing that peaceful warnings are over.  \n",
    "> *Economy as Target* — Lines about crashing the stock market and “corporate trees of greed” reframe the fight as economic sabotage, not just information war.  \n",
    "> *Spiritual Escalation* — Continuous references to wrath of God, Legion, and velociraptors elevate conflict from cyber‑ops to biblical end‑game.  \n",
    "> *Structural Note* — Verses accelerate to short, clipped threats (“187 / Motherfuckers thought it was a game”), mimicking gun‑burst cadence.  \n",
    "> *Live Visual Cue* — Stage lights drop to red strobes; screens show ticker symbols glitching to zero while ash falls from the rig.  \n",
