    "> **EverLight’s Rite — Lyrical Dissection & Commentary**  \n",
    "> **Album Mood Shift** — “Ashes” lit the match; “Dark With the Magic” walks through the fire. The production drops to minor‑key 808s with reversed choirs, signalling the record’s descent into night‑ops territory.  \n",
    "> **Automatic vs. Arcane** — Hawk blends gun metaphors (“automatic tactic”) with spellcasting (“dark with the magic”) to show that tech and sorcery are two sides of the same weapon. The refrain repeats twice to emphasize that the dark arts are now fully weaponized.  \n",
    "> **Narrative Lens** — The tale of a “bird who with words killed the devil with his spells” re‑casts Hawk as a mythic phoenix, linking back to earlier bird imagery (“Swordfish,” “Last One Left”).  \n",
    "> **Structural Device** — Each verse is capped by a **two‑line micro‑hook** (“I let loose / With this automatic tactic”), giving live crowds an easy chant while verses stay lyrically dense.  \n",
    "> **Target Update** — Politicians, pedophiles, corporate “trees of greed” and even the literal devil—Hawk’s hit‑list is now global, spiritual, and personal.  \n",
    "> **Live Visual Cue** — Stage turns ultraviolet; glyphs projected on floor form a magic circle. Every time the hook says “automatic,” strobes fire like muzzle flashes.  \n",
