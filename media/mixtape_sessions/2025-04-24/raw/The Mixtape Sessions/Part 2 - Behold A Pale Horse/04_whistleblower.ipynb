    ">   \n",
    "> **Resistance Manifesto** — This is the album’s clearest salute to whistleblowers-as-warriors. Snowden, Assange, and Manning are name-checked to open the track, setting the stage for a **first-person battle cry** of lyrical exposure.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **No Mercy Flow** — The rhyme chains here are hostile and unrelenting—Hawk Eye turns his mic into a weaponized subpoena. The bars are more like charges filed in rhythm.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Symbolism Overdrive** — “Blowing whistle,” “consensus,” “classified,” “defectors,” “non-compliance” — the semantic field is pure intel warfare. Think Edward Snowden rapping a declassified drop over a war drum.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Narrative Position** — Track 4 solidifies the *militant testimony* phase of the album. If “William Cooper” framed the problem, and “Kamikaze” screamed defiance, “Whistleblower” starts issuing indictments.  \n",
