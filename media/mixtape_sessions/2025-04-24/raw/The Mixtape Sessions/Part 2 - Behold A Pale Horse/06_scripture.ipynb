    "\n",
    "Martyr’s Premonition — Infect the World is the emotional nucleus of the album. Hawk Eye channels the fear, grief, rage, and inevitability that truth-tellers feel. Every line drips with prophetic resignation. It’s the sound of someone who has already accepted the cost of resistance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whistleblower to Warlord Arc — This track transitions from exposé to execution. From “I told the world about the girls and boys they sell” to “my martyrdom will then infect the world,” it’s no longer about warnings — it’s a spiritual contagion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Symbol: Infection — “Infection” becomes a holy virus. It’s the antithesis of mind control. If the system spreads lies like disease, Hawk Eye’s lyrics become the cure — invasive, irreversible, and untreatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreshadowed Fallout — “Why haven’t they killed me yet?” — Hawk turns his survival into a taunt, a dare, a riddle. And if he’s silenced? That silence will scream.\n",
