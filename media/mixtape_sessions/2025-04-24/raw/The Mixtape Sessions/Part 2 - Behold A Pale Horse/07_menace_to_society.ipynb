    "\n",
    "Mental Health as Control Mechanism — This track boldly challenges the use of diagnoses as social silencing. Once you’re labeled, you’re no longer heard. “Once they label you as schizophrenic, no one gives a damn.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Criminalization of Consciousness — Hawk Eye draws a direct line between truth-speaking and persecution. From house raids to media spin, the lyrics highlight how the system neutralizes voices that awaken others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Breaker Thesis — Tied to the mythology from Full Disclosure, this track aims to inspire a generation “unafraid to make the matrix fold.” It’s a call to spiritual insurrection disguised as a paranoid breakdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martyr Echoes — Still reeling from Scripture and Whistleblower, this track adds institutional psychiatry and surveillance culture to the enemy roster — painting the artist as both fugitive and messiah figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested Visuals / Links\n",
