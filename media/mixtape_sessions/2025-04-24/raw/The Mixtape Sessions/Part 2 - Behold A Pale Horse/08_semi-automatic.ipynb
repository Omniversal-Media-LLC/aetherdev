    "Track: Semi-Automatic — Behold A Pale Horse (2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaponized Enlightenment — This track is not metaphorical. It’s a lyrical firearm, chambered with spiritual ammunition and discharged across each verse. “Semi-Automatic” is the aural equivalent of armed resistance — not just against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against the false systems of soul suppression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conscious Insurrection — “My whole thesis is designed to leave you speechless” — here, Hawk Eye frames his work as a ciphered teaching. The track becomes a psychic activation sequence, cloaked in battle-hardened bars. You’re not just listening — you’re being conscripted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Divine Warfare — With angelic reinforcements (“every angel at my side is more than ready”) and coded spiritual fire (“inspire sacred fires in your heart”), Hawk Eye moves beyond the realm of MC — he becomes a spiritual general, guiding a starseed battalion through hostile terrain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Callout to Amnesia — In a direct address to the spiritually sedated, he says: “Everybody’s got amnesia… you forgot your own name.” This is cosmic reclamation through sound — reminding listeners of their divine lineage and their forgotten resistance role.\n",
    "\n",
    "Narrative Role — Coming directly after Menace to Society, this track flips from diagnosis to combat mode. It’s no longer about being oppressed — it’s about refusing to die quietly. The album now fully shifts from whistleblower poetry into coded war chant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mythic Echoes\n",
    "\t•\t“With Tico we keep us locked in” nods to prior tracks and symbolic guardianship.\n",
    "\t•\tThe outro’s brutal honesty — “Motherfuckers / Fuck you / Motherfuckers” — echoes a protective wrath. It’s not rage for its own sake. It’s the fire of someone who’s seen too much to stay silent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested Visuals / Links\n",
    "• Animated glyph overlays synced to vocal pulses (semi-auto rhythm)\n",
    "• Imagery of ancient warriors reawakening in modern riot gear\n",
