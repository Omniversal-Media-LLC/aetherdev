    ">   \n",
    "> **Opening Salvo** — The very first bars serve literal notice: Hawk Eye has returned to escalate the insurgency first charted in *Full Disclosure*. “Warnin’ shots” aren’t stray bullets; they’re **sonic flares** marking the perimeter of Album #2’s battlefield.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **William Cooper Invocation** — Dedicating the track to Cooper welds 1990s conspiratorial prophecy to 2020’s crisis crescendo. It signals that the album will unpack **Behold A Pale Horse** (the book) in rhyme form—turning Cooper’s thesis into drill‑sergeant mantras.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Flow Mechanics** — Four‑bar clusters stack internal rhymes (“existential differential / providential central”) like encryption hashes, daring would‑be decoders to keep up. The cadence snaps between **trip‑hammer couplets** and elongated prophet‑voice proclamations, mirroring the tension between urgency and inevitability.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Myth‑Tech Hybrids** — Lines about “reincarnated galactic warlord” and “alien translation” splice esoteric lore with cyber‑warfare imagery, cementing the **StarWalker** mythology introduced in earlier singles. Rap becomes both ritual invocation and comms jamming.  \n",
    ">   \n",
    "> **Narrative Foreshadow** — Repeated vows to “heal this world back to life” preview the Phoenix arc that peaks at Track 8 “Ashes,” while threats to demons and agents lay groundwork for the tactical treatises (“Sun Tzu: Secretz To War,” “Kamikaze”) later in the record.  \n",
