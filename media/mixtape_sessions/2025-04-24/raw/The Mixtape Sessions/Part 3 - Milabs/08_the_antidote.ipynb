    "“Here’s what you need…” (repeated refrain)\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn’t a suggestion — it’s a prescription. The repetition mimics a mantra or coded injection, with the speaker (Hawk Eye) positioning himself as a spiritual pharmacist, armed with language as cure.\n",

    "This verse flips the mask off both government and media.\n",
    "Hawk Eye names the predatory agenda behind ‘child agendas’, and satirizes the ritualized spectacle of pop culture identity manipulation, from celebrity gender transitions to performative social reform.\n",

    "Language isn’t a tool here — it’s a living entity, animated with shamanic will.\n",
