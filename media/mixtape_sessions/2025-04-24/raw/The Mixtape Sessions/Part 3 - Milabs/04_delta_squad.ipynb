    "Track: Delta Squad — Milabs (2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the “supersoldier awakening” track.\n",
    "Where previous bars alluded to hidden trauma, Delta Squad is a fully restored war journal. It’s Max Spiers. It’s Project Treadstone. It’s whistleblowing through mnemonic weaponization.\n",

    "🧬 Trauma Recall & Inverted Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "“It first surfaced when these curses were reversed and I reclaimed”\n",
    "This track opens with activated remembrance. Like psychic decryption, the artist has reclaimed stolen memories — reversed engineered from suppressed “abreactions” — and now speaks from the inside out.\n",

    "⚔️ Music as Insurrection\n",
    "\n",
    "“This music set’s ‘em loose”\n",
    "This is one of the track’s core mechanics. The music doesn’t just expose mind control — it disrupts it. It is a psychic contagion designed to reactivate other sleepers, triggering resistance in those still trapped inside.\n",
