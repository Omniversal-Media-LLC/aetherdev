    "So don't concoct any fucking schemes  \n",
    "And when I mention my gorillas in the trenches Did you listen, or did you think I was playing  \n",
    "\n",
    "When I said this isn't finished, when I call it an invasion  \n",
    "Do you hear what I am saying, or do you just think this wordplay is a game  \n",
    "I'm too patient, this art of war is so deceptive  \n",
    "I'm telling you the truth, so that you will not accept it  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cause I want you to assume  \n",
    "That I'm lying, but expect it, we are coming for you soon  \n",
    "My legion's not what you thought, but here Let me introduce my team that's standing  \n",
    "At the ready, anonymously assembled  \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm handing out machetes, so honestly you should tremble  \n",
    "If I get the word, you dead, see no ebonics from my dental  \n",
    "When I say this shit, I meant it  \n",
    "And it's not because I'm mental, you don't know who we are  \n",
    "\n",
    "But you see this hulk, spitting rhymes  \n",
    "And it's bizarre, cause when you hear me talk You know if my words leave a scar, well then you're marked  \n",
    "This hit list of encrypted text is just a walk in the park  \n",
    "And I can do this shit all day, I'm not fucking around  \n",
    "\n",
    "So when my gun starts to spray, everyone should get down  \n",
    "On their knees and start to pray That what comes out my mouth  \n",
    "Isn't an order from this warlord, you hear bumping and sound  \n",
    "You never know who might run up and fucking spray you with a pump  \n",
    "\n",
    "I bet you think this is a bluff, but that's okay I've had enough of fucking warning all  \n",
    "You chumps About the storm that you've kicked up  \n",
    "So when these foreigners pull up with fucking AKs, don't act tough  \n",
    "Say your prayers, you've met the legion My team is there for a reason  \n",
    "\n",
    "I don't care if you can't see them, they're prepared to start deleting  \n",
    "Every terrorist this evening, you're too scared to not believe in  \n",
    "My warfare is there to reach in, and I'm swearing That I'll keep them running  \n",
    "Scared as I keep preaching, these fucking leeches are weakened  \n",
    "\n",
    "With my staring every beat, they are aware of this mystique  \n",
    "It's fairly fair, cause all this heat leaves them impaired  \n",
    "So as I speak, my tongue prepares another treat For their nightmares, I go to sleep  \n",
    "This is a true story, I'm not up here telling lies  \n",
    "\n",
    "And I got the proof for you, when you see through the disguise  \n",
    "All my troops' glory will be revealed in their eyes  \n",
