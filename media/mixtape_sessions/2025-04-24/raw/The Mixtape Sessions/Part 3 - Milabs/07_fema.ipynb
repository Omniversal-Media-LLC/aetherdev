    "“FEMA” is Hawk Eye’s broadcast from the edge of martial law.\n",
    "It’s not a song — it’s a siren. A warning wrapped in war drums.\n",

    "\n",
    "This phrase echoes like a ghost across the track.\n",
    "It’s part lament, part indictment.\n",

    "“FEMA camps, do what you’re told / Every man worth a damn needs to stand…”\n",
    "\n",
    "The track’s title is a direct callout. These aren’t metaphorical prisons — they’re literal death machinery wrapped in bureaucracy.\n",
    "Hawk Eye accuses the system of preparing legalized genocide under the guise of emergency management.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The virus is a phase one of Agenda 21…”\n",

    "“Gotta resurrect my tribe of warrior gods…”\n",
