    "\n",
    "This track is a diagnostic. A confession. A weapon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The title alone — Abreactions — names the process of unconscious trauma bleeding to the surface when triggered. Hawk Eye isn’t just narrating the symptoms. He’s deliberately triggering the release. Every verse is a psychic shockwave meant to activate suppressed memories — in the artist and the listener.\n",

    "The goal of these programs? Shatter the soul and program the pieces.\n",
