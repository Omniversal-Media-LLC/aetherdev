    "This music I use it like cupid now watch  \n",
    "These abusive acoustics break down the whole plot  \n",
    "My conclusive intrusion is ruthless I brought  \n",
    "Enough ammunition to position myself right up front  \n",
    "Demolition is my mission fully loaded with this gun  \n",
    "This transmission leaves em wishing my ambition was a stunt  \n",
    "But this tactician's exposition's so persistent when it comes  \n",
    "The subliminal conditioning keeps you inside your cage  \n",
    "But with these rhythmical medicinals I am here to rearrange  \n",
    "These traditional municipals installed inside your brain  \n",
    "By this digital encryption you never knew to blame  \n",
    "But ai is what they use to abuse and confuse  \n",

    "By this system's predictive wisdom now listen here's the truth  \n",
    "Hypnotically controlled by lights and sounds you do not fight  \n",
    "You watch a movie that is proving what this music that I write  \n",
    "Exposes but you lose focus hocus pocus satellites  \n",
    "I say they live was tryna warn you bout these locust parasites  \n",
    "But that's just fiction your addiction has restricted your own mind  \n",
    "So that your affliction gets depicted by descriptive written rhymes  \n",
    "But these prescriptions I'm inflicting with this diction are designed  \n",
    "To constrict and then evict every script that keeps you blind  \n",
    "They tell it to you through a screen so that you won't believe  \n",
    "That any of these things exist but I resist that dream  \n",
    "As I persist they just insist on tryna twist this scene  \n",
    "So my hitlist keeps growin it's a bitch I wish this team  \n",
    "Of hypnotists could finally see that I ain't backin down  \n",
    "My words are packed with enough facts to make dracula drown  \n",
    "In a pool of blood this fucking flood just attacks  \n",
    "This sound of mine's divine and everytime it counteracts you clowns  \n",
    "So just fall back as I reload in this track as I expose  \n",
    "How all you hijacked drones only react to the codes  \n",
    "I send my mental bullets from this pulpit and hack these clonse  \n",
    "Then reattach them to your faction  \n",
    "Watch your back who knows  \n",
    "Your most trusted men might bust in on my orders  \n",
    "And relay this message to you as a warning  \n",
    "If you think that I am playing they'll come swarming in  \n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to Act III\n",
    "From the jump, this tape makes no apologies — Soft Disclosure is the psychic siren to announce the alien abduction arc and declare war on one of the most insidious enemies yet: covert technological manipulation via mass media. This is a track about how truth gets wrapped in fiction until your consciousness forgets how to fight back.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Predictive Programming as Prophecy\n",
    "\n",
    "The phrase “X-Files was soft disclosure fucking with your brain” isn’t just a punchline — it’s a thesis statement. This track outlines how Hollywood, sci-fi, and “fictional” content are used as gradual acclimations to the truth. The key? If the masses see the reality too fast, the collective psyche fractures. So instead, it’s dosed in digestible, deniable fiction.\n",

    "“You watch a movie that is proving what this music that I write / Exposes but you lose focus hocus pocus satellites”\n",

    "Hawk Eye argues that entertainment is not neutral — it’s spiritual anesthetic. The chorus-less structure mimics this urgency — no hooks, no breaks, just sustained cognitive bombardment.\n",

    "🧬 AI, Enslavement, and Digital Ritual\n",
    "\n",
    "“AI is what they use to abuse and confuse”\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the antagonist isn’t just Wetiko — it’s its technological interface. AI is framed as the vector of parasitic suggestion, injecting hypnotic reinforcement into the populace via media, “predictive wisdom,” and broadcast sorcery.\n",

    "“With these rhythmical medicinals I am here to rearrange”\n",

    "This bar alone reframes the entire tape: the track is medicine, and each rhyme is a data-encoded spell to dismantle mental cages. It’s not just music. It’s mythic inoculation.\n",

    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🛰️ Narrative Placement\n",
    "\n",
    "Positioned as the opening track of Milabs, Soft Disclosure functions like a decryption key. It calibrates the listener’s expectations: this album will not be easy. It will scramble the signal. It’s here to wake you up, not comfort you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beat, structure, and lack of repetition reflect the unrelenting flow of propaganda — and Hawk Eye’s refusal to let the rhythm conform. This track isn’t about bars — it’s about bypassing the firewall of false perception.\n",
