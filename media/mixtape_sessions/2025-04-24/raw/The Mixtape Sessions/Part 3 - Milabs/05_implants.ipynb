    "\n",
    "This control system keeps 'em weakened - automatic sleeping  \n",
    "We can sneak in and delete them if these sheep begin to speak  \n",
    "Before belief strengthens their defense, or mystique deploys this pretense  \n",

    "Lyrical Dissection & Commentary\n",
    "Track: Implants — Milabs (2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "“Implants” is psychological warfare through parody and prophecy.\n",
    "The first half of this track flips the script — Hawk Eye ventriloquizes the parasitic elite, exposing their internal strategy through mockery and mimicry. What follows is retaliation. This is not a track. This is a spiritual counter-assault.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "👁️‍🗨️ Parasitic Gameplan: Revealed\n",
    "\n",
    "“Let’s dumb ’em down with the poison & fuck up their whole frame”\n",
    "\n",
    "The opening stanzas read like a Luciferian playbook. From DNA suppression to fluoride mind control, from television as hypnotist to frequency-based entrainment — Hawk Eye narrates the system from the inside out.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s satire, yes — but it’s deadly accurate. These aren’t punchlines. These are blueprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Frequency-Based Enslavement\n",
    "\n",
    "“We blast this frequency so they can’t see how we keep our hold”\n",
    "\n",
    "This line cuts into scalar weaponry and ELF/MindNet tech. The idea here: surveillance is not enough — control must be vibrational. The airwaves become a cage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implants — both physical and metaphysical — amplify that control.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🔥 The Tone Switch: Reclamation\n",
    "\n",
    "The mid-track shift is literal. The satire breaks, and Hawk Eye enters:\n",
    "\n",
    "“Hold up… I’m Hawk Eye, right?”\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the sound of realization and retaliation. From there, the bars ignite into battle chants. The narrative flips — the hunted becomes the hunter.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "⚔️ Mystic Warfare & Divine Rebellion\n",
    "\n",
    "“Resistin’ all attempts to enslave / I’m too brave to behave”\n",
    "\n",
    "Now he’s fully awake — spitting with ritual precision and cosmic clarity. The implants and fear programs? Nullified. This is Hawk Eye in full spiritual combat mode — the frequency fence overridden.\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "🗝️ Final Hex-Lifting & Mass Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "“They can poison our minds but they can’t keep us blind”\n",
    "\n",
    "The track ends with a broadcast of liberation codes. The people aren’t weak — they’re programmed to think they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key? Remember who you are. Stay aligned, stay speaking, stay awake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spell only works if you accept it.\n",

    "\t•\tHolographic “Hawk Eye vs Hypnotist” battle animation\n",
    "\n",
    "⸻\n",
    "\n",
    "Implants may be the most self-aware track on Milabs so far — and the most subversively playful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hawk Eye doesn’t just break the fourth wall — he demolishes the programming behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mockery as magic. Exposure as exorcism.\n",
