# Track 10 â€” Monumental

Blast back at niggas, before they get bigger
Got God on my side, I ainâ€™t worried about triggers
Make my way through the thoroughfare, daring them to snicker
All these demons know my name, they keep glaring as I deliver

A message to the devil, written in blood
That says Iâ€™m back, so donâ€™t press your luck
I recorded him this track that says I donâ€™t give a fuck
So he will know Iâ€™ve got him trapped when I hit him with this stud

Missile, blow the whistle, Iâ€™m detrimental with this pencil
Transcendental instrumentals keep me going, itâ€™s fundamental
To always let your enemies know youâ€™re monumental
And itâ€™s not coincidental, when they came at you as officials

Decimate all competition, make them hate for you to mention
That the only way to survive is full submission
Leave them wishing the coalition had a chance
We were visionâ€”something other than plagiarism

Total demolition, I could keep going
But I think you get the picture, Satan ainâ€™t trying me
He knows Iâ€™m the victim, thereâ€™s never been a war I didnâ€™t win
This holy scripture that Iâ€™m penning is the winning truth serum

My mixture keeps the demons back
So that you can just relax
I got enough ammunition in my kitchen
To hijack a whole nation of patriots waiting to attack

I got the juice, I let loose
And all these pussies looking whack
No facade, Iâ€™m a militant, diligent bard
Who can write a verse that makes heaven quakeâ€”itâ€™s not hard

I just put this pen to paper and take off like a star
I hesitate to debate you, I am not gonna spar
I destroy everything that gets in my way
Thatâ€™s why the devil avoids me, cause heâ€™s too afraid

All hell couldnâ€™t stop me if they wanted, okay
Didnâ€™t you get the message? Iâ€™m about to invade
Back at it with the magic, my tactics are suits
Before you even pull, so I can laugh at your doom

I gotta master this craft thatâ€™s pragmatic, you fool
I ainâ€™t waiting for your ass to bounce back, itâ€™s the rule
If you wanna die now, I can pencil you in
If youâ€™re gonna act wild, then it might not end

As well as you hope, I am not your friend
Once this fireâ€™s stoked, canâ€™t put it out, so donâ€™t tempt
Me to let you see a way to escape
I didnâ€™t battle the devil â€” that faggot got raped

I put him back in the box and told him to wait
Because I donâ€™t like chasing after my prey
I got a couple of weapons that I like to use
The first is my name â€” Hawkeye is the truth

When I spit in this booth, itâ€™s uncouth
Thereâ€™s no use in trying to die â€” why riot when youâ€™re just gonna lose
If you wanna die now, I can pencil you in
If youâ€™re gonna act wild, then it might not end

As well as you hope, I am not your friend
Once this fireâ€™s stoked, canâ€™t put it out, so donâ€™t tempt
Me to let you see a way to escape
I didnâ€™t battle the devil â€” that faggot got raped
