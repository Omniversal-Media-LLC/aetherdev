# Fuck Society (First Testament Finale)

So I just decided, fuck it.
I’m gonna sleep in a tent.
I’m gonna do what I love for a living, which is playing music.
And if I just make a little bit of money, I’d rather do what I love with a passion
than go back to contracting and try to make a lot of money
and be part of a society that doesn’t even want me.

Fuck society, they lie to me
I feel them when they’re eyeing me
I know I got a young side, but why these bitches trying me?
Don’t they know I’m infinite?
War games in the shit, go check your box, I’m sending it
Bomb threats when I spit, text away I’m at home
Shitting on the microphone
You know something that I don’t?
Told y’all I’m just writing songs
Got witnesses, I’m in my zone

Psychobabble, fuck these towers
I know how to rape these cowards
Take and replace the power
In loose sleeve, graphite leaks
Pitch a jet, smoke a leaf

Sacred fire, Hawk’s a liar?
I think he should join the choir
Preaching at me like a clone
I’m teaching—at least go find a home

I think that we should each move on
Instead of fighting for the throne
I’m willing to win this war
If we even know it’s war
Cause everybody’s gotta start
Doing his or her part
To change this world—there’s more
Than all these words I’m meant to impart

Sussing this through your heart
So you don’t stumble in the dark
I like to guide—find your way
A bright side to keep you brave
Something else, I should shake
This shit will never ever change
And you will always be a slave
If this system keeps persisting

Showtime means you need a vision
A life outside this place is prison
3D is anchoring down the rest
And until it is dealt with here, and until this is fixed
It’s causing trouble for the other higher frequencies too

That’s why the higher vibrational beings are incarnating down here
To help, because it’s been going on too long now
It’s really really been going on so long that
and you know, people are not realizing
it’s so in your face, it’s so clearly in your face
And that people are still not realizing that it’s going on

Fuck society, I’m rioting
I can’t believe I’m piloting
This skeleton, so delicate
Through hell again, to devil’s men

Hawking’s back, he’s heaven-sent
I’ve come to yell—it’s evident
And I will never let him win
Reincarnated to resist

If I thought that I could fail
I never would have come to tell
The story of our former glory
Now I must assail
This attack is aimed at you

All you demons think you’re cuter
Soulless soul can break home through
Your cage and glue away
Who knew that I could come back with facts
And make all your foundations

Wrecked by vision
Take all nations back—creation’s waiting
I attack everything that you constructed
Told you bitches not to fuck with me

So now I’ll make you see
Why I really wasn’t bluffing
And take the devil back to hell
Goodbye, Satan—wishing well
This war is over

All my friends are luminous
Can’t make amends—
Earth called out, I’m back again
And now my tribe can start to mend
The damage done by wavering
And God forgives us for our sins

If we ever lose our way
Then I just hope and pray
That our stars will shine
And remind us of a brighter day
Than light can take

I hope a way to summarize
Will be okay
No need to give up
Trust me—I’ll keep these demons in the bank

That pedophilia is becoming acceptable on television
That they’re inverting sexuality
That they’re emasculating men
That they’re masculinizing females

I mean, it’s so blatantly obvious
And it disgusts me that people are still not paying attention to it
It’s kind of boring
That this nonsense prevails

Yes…
And also…
I think “boring” is a very lightweight term for what I feel.
