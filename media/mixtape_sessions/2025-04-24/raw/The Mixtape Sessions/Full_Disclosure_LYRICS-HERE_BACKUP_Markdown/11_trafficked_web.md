# Track 11 â€“ Trafficked

This prayer goes out to all of the children who have been caught up in the human trafficking trade.
Theyâ€™re out there right now, yo.

â¸»

[Verse 1]
Speak my poetry, you know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me, the potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be the only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be all on me as you listen to these rhymes

I hit the devil in the head with a shovel, now heâ€™s dead
I got in trouble with the feds, but now Iâ€™m doubling my besties
Goddamn demons better run before I clean them all at once
I got a feeling if I bust out, know I mean itâ€”I donâ€™t bluff

Not here to play their fucking games
I got a bunch of shit to say
But first I need you all to know that all this greed has got to go
All you starseeds have to grow, and I will bleed to make it so

â¸»

[Verse 2]
So listen up, this is the truthâ€”the system fucked over the youth
This twisted shit keeps us enslaved and while we sleep the demons play
You donâ€™t believe me when I say that kids get trafficked every day
If you donâ€™t see it, you donâ€™t knowâ€”thatâ€™s why I reveal it in these songs

To make you stop and take a look
Thatâ€™s how we end itâ€”hereâ€™s the hook:

[Hook]
Speak my poetry, you know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me, the potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be the only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be all on me as you listen to these rhymes

â¸»

[Verse 3]
One more thing I gotta writeâ€”we can end this shit tonight
All we gotta do is fight your silence and greed, lead compliance
If you wanna win this war, first you must find out who you are
Are you gonna play your part? If youâ€™re too scared, then donâ€™t start

This is only for the strongâ€”you just think this is a song
If you dare to sing along, I can prove that you are wrong
All my heroes are now dead, they got murdered for what they said
And I am speaking to my legion when I say itâ€™s not a threat

They kill anyone too braveâ€”so when Iâ€™m rotting in my grave
Just know that I refuse to cave or be their little fucking slave
Take a moment now, all I think is a ship about to sink
Whoâ€™s gonna save it? Are we weak or just blinded by deceit?

[Verse 4]
I wish the best to Satanâ€™s team as I molest the whole scene
I make them stop and call the cops, blind them and chalk it so mean
That when Iâ€™m done, they have to run because they donâ€™t know how I won
Make them embellish on this hellish nightmare when I come

I donâ€™t intend to let them liveâ€”when I go in, I never give
Up space to breathe, so all the sins are in their faces like a siege
Iâ€™m spitting mace, I make them bleed, leave not a traceâ€”itâ€™s what they need
They run in places, I proceed to outpace all enemies

â¸»

[Verse 5]
I tried to warn the devil twice, but I guess three times will suffice
You keep on running, Iâ€™ll keep gunningâ€”yes, Iâ€™m coming for your life
You better think about this shitâ€”I am a warlord, I donâ€™t quit
If you want more, youâ€™ll get more than you can handle, bitch

[Hook â€“ Final Refrain]
Speak my poetry, you know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me, the potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be the only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be all on me as you listen to these rhymes
