# Shakur

## by Hawk Eye The Rapper
### from the album Full Disclosure

This world is such a
And when I say this world I mean it
I donâ€™t mean in an ideal sense
I mean in an everyday
Every little thing you do
Itâ€™s such a
Gimme gimme gimme
Everybody back off
You know what everybodyâ€™s like
And youâ€™re taught that from school
Everywhere
Big business
You wanna be successful
You wanna be like Trump
Gimme gimme gimme
Push push push push
Step step step

Theyâ€™re so greedy
I donâ€™t think they can see
Why is everybody always pushing me
Theyâ€™re so greedy
If only they could see
I wish everybody would stop pushing me

You push me
I push back
I ainâ€™t even gotta clap
Put your lights out quick
Now just listen to this rap
If this time bomb ticks
Thereâ€™s no telling when it quits
If you niggas wanna scrap
I hope you get your brains fixed
I ainâ€™t even tryna play
I could do this shit all day
But you canâ€™t
So Iâ€™m with this world
Ainâ€™t ready for this song
Iâ€™m a menace fan
Iâ€™m sold with a vengeance
Bring it on
I told the devil
Pipe down and turn my music up

Theyâ€™re so greedy
I donâ€™t think they can see
Why is everybody always pushing me
Theyâ€™re so greedy
If only they could see
I wish everybody would stop pushing me

Sit down little clowns
Yeah I see you tryna frown
Turn around before my fucking hookah stuck in your bowels
Cause I came to rip it up and make you shit
So donâ€™t cluck you fucking chickens
Get the fuck
You just wish this shit was left
But I work every day to make sure that what Iâ€™m saying gets heard
Every word so you know Iâ€™m not playing
If Illuminati are humble then good
I wonâ€™t stumble
They might fumble
Then Iâ€™ll crush them all under my thumb

Theyâ€™re so greedy
I donâ€™t think they can see
Why is everybody always pushing me
Theyâ€™re so greedy
If only they could see
I wish everybody would stop pushing me

One more thing
Before I go away
Hawkeye is back
Iâ€™m not Shakur but Iâ€™ll stay
If you wanna go
I will still remain
But you wonâ€™t soak me
Careful what you say
Whole worldâ€™s watching
All eyes on me
Hawk will make them lay down
Yeah watch them watching me
Many men died tryna speak the truth
But these puppets canâ€™t touch it
Living legend in this mood

Theyâ€™re so greedy
I donâ€™t think they can see
Why is everybody always pushing me
Theyâ€™re so greedy
If only they could see
I wish everybody would stop pushing me
