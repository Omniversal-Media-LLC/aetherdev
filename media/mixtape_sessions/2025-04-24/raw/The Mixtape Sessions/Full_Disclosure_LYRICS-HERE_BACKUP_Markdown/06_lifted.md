# Lifted

Canâ€™t tell me shit, Iâ€™m done with it
This slow digit is fun to kids
And if you wanna run against all shit
Iâ€™ll leave you wondering how come Hawkâ€™s so gunning it
Roll back the clouds, need no defense
Illuminauts stand under it
Donâ€™t understand I won this shit
This war is over, I am here
And I am â€™bout to make you feel like
You should run to Holy Fields before I bite your fucking ear

Let all who hear never fear
Anything but evil exesâ€”thatâ€™s when Legion attacks
Writing raps and setting traps is all Iâ€™m doing
Take me back, but watch out for these matrix traps
Actually, who gives a crap
Just stand back and listen to my acrobats
Linguistic chess with battle raps
Egg the devil on with tracks
Cause Iâ€™m gonna give him heart attacks

That we can all connect to and heal from is whatâ€™s being altered
on an earth grid level and also on a cosmic levelâ€¦
But if we donâ€™t stand into alignment with it,
we are easily ushered into an artificial timelineâ€¦

So humans have a choice:
Do you wanna connect with whatâ€™s real and organic
And whatâ€™s really happening in the cosmos and on Earth
Or do you wanna allow the imitation and replica versionâ€”
Which is what AI is all about, and transhumanismâ€”
Keep you in those distortions?

If I fail, this shit gets underwritten
You can all have fun with it
Iâ€™m lifted off this tongue just when I spit
And words get runninâ€™ shit
Satan tries to fuck with this
His hands get burned from plunderinâ€™
Speak and make the demons run
I guess you say Iâ€™m runninâ€™ shit

Before they make me crack my whip
I make â€˜em all stand under it
If they donâ€™t, this pistol grip come back
And it is so legit that their bravado starts to slip
And half of Hell just crawls and squips
Evil with this languageâ€”shit
Donâ€™t listen to my spell and script

Iâ€™m here to push the devil back
And trap him in my battle raps
He canâ€™t escape from my wrath
Spit out the cold like aftermath
So wicked is the smoking path
A mind that none should ever clap
No applause is necessary
Iâ€™m doinâ€™ this to break the scepter

Iâ€™m taking seat up from the heat
And if you even think to speak
Iâ€™ll make you wish my tongue was weak
You canâ€™t escape from my mystique
Iâ€™m breakinâ€™ down and punishinâ€™
All you demons runninâ€™ shit
Cause I am tired of wonderinâ€™
Whoâ€™s to blame for runninâ€™ shit

This world was fucked but Iâ€™m the cure
You girls can suck my dick
Iâ€™m certain that if you even stood a chance
I wouldnâ€™t have to make you glance
My way as I take a stance
So fill you up, cause I wonâ€™t dance
Iâ€™ll shoot you all with instant vengeance
Since you canâ€™t lay a hand

My tactics, as I practice, see dramatic
Attractive basics I designed to make you panic
Yes I know you cannot stand it
But I am here to take your Xanax
And break your face with my semantics
Cause all you fuckinâ€™ gears are damaged
I am your damnâ€”
