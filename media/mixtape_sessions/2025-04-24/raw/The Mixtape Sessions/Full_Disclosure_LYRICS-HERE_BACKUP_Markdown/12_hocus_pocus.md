# Track 12 - Hocus Pocus

I know yâ€™all wondering how I do this shit but Iâ€™ll tell you the truth itâ€™s straight up magic
Hocus pocus yâ€™all
You donâ€™t believe me
Listen to this

Iâ€™m meticulous with this pen I go in just for sport
Infamous when I sim like Iâ€™m showing support
Instruments get me in the mood to do work
Limitless I begin to exude all sort

Of prowess Iâ€™m boundless this towerâ€™s making them slaves
To the sound is profound this powerâ€™s creating a wave
These potions potent emotions flow like oceans when I say
Hocus pocus now focus itâ€™s no joke this display

Is what happens when rapping becomes more than just art
Itâ€™s a movement so fluid like a druid I start
With this magic I craft it then attack with my heart
Got it mastered these bastards cannot match it itâ€™s too dark

Voldemort ainâ€™t got shit on me thatâ€™s all Iâ€™mma say
Iâ€™m literally casting spells yâ€™all
I consider myself to be of the grey path
Neither black nor white balanced I figure

If the darkness gonna use dark magic I might as well use magic too
Preeminent on the mic none can handle this flow
Eloquent when I write itâ€™s a scandal I know
Affectionate with the light so you can channel my glow

Permanently aligned canâ€™t dismantle my soul
My incantations move nations when my station is broadcast
Thereâ€™s no debating hesitating awaiting when I rap
These creations Iâ€™m making take dedication

I move fast apply the brakes and these fakes will just take
Take it all back my mission and position
This transmission is too great for most to witness
So this hit list donâ€™t forget shit I just read the news to you

So that your crew can go back to school while I wait
Gotta know the rules to use these tools all you fools have died late
I know affectionate with the light so you can channel my glow
Permanently aligned canâ€™t dismantle my soul

My incantations move nations when my station is broadcast
