# Track 9 â€” Dark With the Magic

Dark with the magic â€” my artâ€™ll kill static
I ainâ€™t even gotta shift gears
My shitâ€™s automatic
Make you fucks learn quick
When I merge into traffic
Push my way into this game like a maverick

Sit down now children
And listen to this tale
Of a bird who with words
Killed the devil with his spells

Yeah listen up bitches
I forgot to mention
Face hit to this dimension
With my legion

Bear witness
Got a brand new shit
Letâ€™s end this war
With the quickness

To get demons out
With this Iâ€™m designed to do business
I ainâ€™t dying on this mission
Gotta fry my competition

I ainâ€™t asking for permission
Take them down like a tactician
Make sure they die well
Send them all back to hell

Grab her with my Adamâ€™s apple
Till this battle rap sells
Iâ€™m a warlord on this mic
A man in army

Says I write not men
No parties
Know my might
And crush your arteries

Oh night
I got the devil in my sights
Send him several invites
To his funeral

The usual
Messages I write
Keep him guessing
If the Smith & Wesson

Lesson just might
Make its way
Through his bulletproof
Teflon tonight

Shoot the shit
With his kids
Leave him spooked
When I spit

In this booth
I am the truth
Itâ€™s no use
I let loose

With this automatic tactic
Shitâ€™s dramatic
When I craft it
Problematic

For these bastards
Trying to come at me
Itâ€™s tragic
I let loose

With this automatic tactic
Shitâ€™s dramatic
When I craft it
Problematic

For these bastards
Trying to come at me
Itâ€™s tragic
For these bastards
Trying to come at me
Itâ€™s tragic
