# Track 15 - The Story of Our Former Glory

Straight flames when I float make the devil loose his hold on these people
All this evil better recall when I show cause I came to cause static
Put Satan in a casket send his demons back to hell and wish him well
Iâ€™m dogmatic once they rest in peace and all these wargames cease

We can finally be released from this matrix that keeps us flying to the truth
You can see it in the youth weâ€™re divine at our roots
We got all the attributes but thatâ€™s another story
First we gotta win this war see Iâ€™ve been fighting since before

We gave away our former glory my soulâ€™s so old that it would scare you
If I told you what I remember divine embers now behold
It is written in the stars we are warriors at heart
Reincarnated beings yeah we came in from afar

Protect this planet at a loss from the demons in the box
Letâ€™s take a look at what weâ€™ve lost we used to all be amazed
By the life that we saved instead of rotting in a grave
We just decided that we stayed but those days are long gone

And now weâ€™re taking roles on ever present this peasant still spawns
In our mind it just blinds and keeps us in this line
If I could just remind you then weâ€™d all be fine
But this life a parasite a scourge of sight so in this fight

Thereâ€™s no light itâ€™s not right but thereâ€™s time
The devil hasnâ€™t won I am back he is done
Now just listen to my raps I insist this is fun
When our tribe comes together thereâ€™s no storm we canâ€™t weather

You donâ€™t have to believe me but I wrote you this letter
Warriors donâ€™t cave under pressure they fight back just for the pleasure
Honor the call and protect this treasure
Tell the devil that youâ€™re ready for whatever

When this cycle ends we will all remember when
Hawkeye and his friends came back just to send
A message to the demons yes I mean it I have truly seen shit
I was here before Eden the anxious ever turned

But none of you have learned thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m teaching as I preach
So I can reach you in a verse you are not alone
Your tribe is here you are home and in the sacred tomb
I crafted this song so that when you hear it

You can study my lyrics so no need to fear
Hawkeye is here all of these darkened days will soon be replaced
So with grace dear soul keep the faith

So almost like both exist so we have sort of this false grid
And then we have the real shift happening which we would call ascension
But to me that word has been so kind of misunderstood
That I just look at it as human advancement

Our capacity to switch on our DNA again
And recognize that itâ€™s coming through the codes of nature
Itâ€™s coming through the core sun within the earth
And itâ€™s coming from the grand central sun and the light codes that are streaming in

And if we can align with that weâ€™re going to easily advance ourselves
