# Last One Left

## by Hawk Eye The Rapper
### from the album Full Disclosure

Last one left
Shout out to all those who come before me
I got a legacy to uphold
Speaking prose through my poetry so it would be felt
Got these niggas trying to go at me but they will be dealt
With accordingly the shits only package of cells

So I can infect minds still trapped in a cell
Last one left
Gotta kill it myself
Make a miracle lyric so severe it defies health
Kill them all when they hear it
Thereâ€™s no time to divide

Well send them on to the next life with a little of my help
Said I came here to kill em with just lyrics so sharp
But just the sound of my breath is enough to stop hearts
So donâ€™t tug at my pen when Iâ€™m penning this dark part
Or I might just go apeshit and tear you apart

Spit it back in your face like itâ€™s mace so donâ€™t start
Hell raiser no grace of mercy to impart
This is my time
I told you itâ€™s scary so depart
Make you very aware of my snare beats flow chart

Terrorist when I go in
So Iâ€™m knowing when it blows
Gotta hear it to fear it
So my message is I own
Every right to use lyrics as weapons at my shoulder
Gonna hate to get near it
Cause the heat on my stove

Is too much to handle
So you might wanna go home
Brandishing handguns is a safe home
All I know is while Iâ€™m languishing with languages
My flow gets ice cold
Freeze all competition

Leave em dead in styrofoam
Make my way to the kitchen
Now just listen when I speak
Grab a knife and it glistens
When I mention in side beat
Stand you all in attention

With this wisdom
Donâ€™t try me
Iâ€™ll leave you wishing
My mission was just to supply heat
Smoke the fire if youâ€™re tired
So I can relax
I broke the choir
Youâ€™re hired
Yeah yeah

And I think fast
Whatâ€™s the most devilish thing I could write in my raps
I guess the devil shouldâ€™ve understood that Iâ€™m back
Hawkeyeâ€™s not a soldier and this is no war
I hear hellâ€™s getting colder
But I wonder what for

Did the devil catch wind of my music
Or is he just running away cause he felt my force
Shoot him up with this chopper just like itâ€™s my chore
Sit in my helicopter and beg him for more
I could let him off
But I promise my sword
That I wonâ€™t let him live
Itâ€™s my duty to war

All the fucking politicians
Bankers and thieves
Got the game gamed up
But donâ€™t know about me
I make them quake in their boots
And drop to their knees
Iâ€™m not much like Jesus
But I make them see

Giving sight to the blind
I just try to unwind
So much might at command
So Iâ€™m taking my time
I make this planet dance
As I remind
Every one of the truth
As I show them the signs

Iâ€™m not much like Jesus
But I make them see
Giving sight to the blind
I just try to unwind
So much might at command
So Iâ€™m taking my time
I make this planet dance
As I remind
Every one of the truth
As I show them the signs
