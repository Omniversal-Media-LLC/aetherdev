# Track 11: Trafficked

This prayer goes out to all of the children
Who have been caught up in the human trafficking trade
Theyâ€™re out there right now, yo

Speak my poetry
You know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me
The potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be
The only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be
All on me as you listen to these rhymes

I hit the devil in the head with a shovel
Now heâ€™s dead
I got in trouble with the feds
But now Iâ€™m doubling my besties

Goddamn demons better run
Before I clean them all at once
I got a feeling if I bust out
Know I mean it, I donâ€™t bluff

Not here to play their fucking games
I got a bunch of shit to say
But first I need you all to know
That all this greed has got to go

All you starseeds have to grow
And I will bleed to make it so
So listen up
This is the truth
The system fucked over the youth

This twisted shit keeps us enslaved
And while we sleep the demons play
You donâ€™t believe me when I say
That kids get trafficked every day

If you donâ€™t see it, you donâ€™t know
Thatâ€™s why I reveal it in these songs
To make you stop and take a look
Thatâ€™s how we end itâ€”hereâ€™s the hook

[Hook]
Speak my poetry
You know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me
The potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be
The only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be
All on me as you listen to these rhymes

One more thing I gotta write
We can end this shit tonight
All we gotta do is fight
Your silence and greed lead compliance

If you wanna win this war
First you must find out who you are
Are you gonna play your part?
If youâ€™re too scared, then donâ€™t start

This is only for the strong
You just think this is a song
If you dare to sing along
I can prove that you are wrong

All my heroes are now dead
They got murdered for what they said
And I am speaking to my legion
When I say itâ€™s not a threat

They kill anyone too brave
So when Iâ€™m rotting in my grave
Just know that I refuse to cave
Or be their little fucking slave

Take a moment now
All I think is a ship about to sink
Whoâ€™s gonna save it?
Are we weak or just blinded by deceit?

[Hook]
Speak my poetry
You know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me
The potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be
The only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be
All on me as you listen to these rhymes

I wish the best to Satanâ€™s team
As I molest the whole scene
I make them stop and call the cops
Blind them and chalk it, so mean

That when Iâ€™m done they have to run
Because they donâ€™t know how I won
Make them embellish on this hellish nightmare
When I come

I donâ€™t intend to let them live
When I go in, I never give
Up space to breathe
So all the sins are in their faces like a siege

Iâ€™m spitting mace
I make them bleed
Leave not a trace
Itâ€™s what they need

They run in places
I proceed
To outpace
All enemies

I tried to warn the devil twice
But I guess three times will suffice
You keep on running
Iâ€™ll keep gunning
Yes, Iâ€™m coming for your life

You better think about this shit
I am a warlordâ€”I donâ€™t quit
If you want more
Youâ€™ll get more
Than you can handle, bitch

[Hook]
Speak my poetry
You know itâ€™s me when I am on the mic
No one flows like me
The potency of this shit is divine
Itâ€™s my hope to be
The only thing floating through your mind
Let your focus be
All on me as you listen to these rhymes
