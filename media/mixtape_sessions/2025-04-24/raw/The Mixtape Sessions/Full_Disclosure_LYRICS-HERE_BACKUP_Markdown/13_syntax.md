# Syntax
So smashing this dramatic climax applies rapid automatic graphic textures with
These death defying antics I design just for practice as my tongue provides the magic for
The twist I send text that I try to spit back at my enemies attacks lay them down
In these tractors like my choreographed action this rap is a fact I canâ€™t win cause I donâ€™t lack
Anything but tact I leave them trapped when I snap then I hack them to pieces tell Jesus that
My thesis is a sleek and form of telekinesis you have found thereâ€™s no weakness my brilliant
Action Jesus is in fact quite ingenious as my power level reaches new heights I think Iâ€™ll
Keep this chip on my shoulder just in case they get bolder this bar will never lower so I let
Their rage smolder they lose their composure cause they cannot gauge closure I told you it gets
Colder hear a rhyme slower like a time bomb ticking I provide the right image for you chickens to keep
Skimming till youâ€™re sickened no limit to my quipping what I pick where to stick my dick in
All these privileged little bitches donâ€™t listen this incantationâ€™s narration makes the devil start
Praying my formation is a religion meant to slay em you donâ€™t want this damn nation it is not a
Vacation his persuasion brings elation so Iâ€™m blatant
No crap can outmatch it all these tragic asthmatics get sick when I speak this
Wicked shit is traumatic flip the switch enigmatic when Iâ€™m in a problematic lunatic
Scriptures that I design with black magic too confident I guess but donâ€™t let yourself miss
An opportunity your cartoon team should not get it twisted Iâ€™ll harpoon your dreams and as you
Scream I wish I had to fucking give no listen as I spit this thunder and be glad I let you live
Run and call the fucking cops Iâ€™m saying shit to make it stop your heart I mean it just seems
Too weak to hear my language stop feel my lyrics when you hear it do not approach me if Iâ€™m near
Cause hold your ears till I declare and make sure youâ€™re not shocked when I circle back around and
Make sure your defense is down if not maybe play the sound youâ€™ll disappear and not be found I told
You motherfucking clowns are creeping through this fucking town to see who thinks Iâ€™m bluffing now
Youâ€™re trusting I wonâ€™t bust it out if I do Iâ€™ll be ready haunt your nightmares like Freddy crucify
Your self esteem in every line my laser beams cut you off now hold steady musical mercenary
The truthâ€™s heavy youâ€™re scared youâ€™ll never be prepared for me
