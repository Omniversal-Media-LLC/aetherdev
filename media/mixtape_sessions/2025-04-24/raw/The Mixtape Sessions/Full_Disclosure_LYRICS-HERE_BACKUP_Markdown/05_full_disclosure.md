# Full Disclosure

## by Hawk Eye The Rapper
### from the album Full Disclosure

This is the title track
If you donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m referencing when I say full disclosure
I suggest you get on Google and do some research
Spit it fire like a dragon
I ainâ€™t trying to kick the habit

If you niggas really want it
You can get it like a match
You burn your whole set down with a lighter and some gasket
I ainâ€™t playing what Iâ€™m saying is Iâ€™m dangerous like magic
Spark it up or half hazard
If you flame then kiss your magic

But this volcano flow will just mellow on the static
If you wanna die today
I can arrange a crash landing
Touch down in your city to rush hour traffic
But you donâ€™t really want Hawk running on your tracks

Cause I might leave you defenseless and just trapped
Hypnotized by the way that Iâ€™m designing all these raps
And the devil canâ€™t help you so just kick it and relax
I ainâ€™t searching for that rat bastard so all of these attacks
At your ego or surregal
Cause Iâ€™m gunning for his ass

And if I act like Steven Seagal
Itâ€™s cause I came to kill evil
And if you get in my way then itâ€™s a wrap
Van Damme on the flow
So the universe can know
Super soldier on the beat
So that full disclosure speaks

I ainâ€™t trying to battle rap
Iâ€™m just here to fucking preach
And I am telling you the facts
So just listen as I teach
9-11 was a cover up
That dark portal reeks

Fluorideâ€™s in the water
So none of you will reach
Be on the fucking bail
And find out what it means
So Antico can just grow
While the elders barely seek

Anything but the way we make money off you freaks
But Hawkeyeâ€™s got your back
Donâ€™t worry Iâ€™mma keep
Pushing back this demon
Keeping all of us asleep
While my tribe heals the world back to life

You got me tempted to do battle
When these snakes start to rattle
Gotta keep it off these streets
Cause I am too great for defeat
Push them back with my raps
Yeah never let them speak

Though theyâ€™re treating us like sheep
Make them weak
Keep their eyes on me
While my tribe puts in the work
Go to war with the beast
Itâ€™s a start but my report

Is enough to crush these fucks
And I hope you wish me luck
Because believe it
I need all of your love
We can fix this world together
And no matter the endeavor

Hawkeyeâ€™s got your back
And Iâ€™m too clever
To ever let the system get me twisted
Now just listen
We are souls on a mission
Stick together
Unite for a purpose

Bigger than the lies
Fight with your focus
Being on saving lives
And we can right all of these wrongs
Together overnight
Iâ€™m not joking
Altogether we can thrive

Send a message to this generation
Let me prophesy
If we donâ€™t stop hesitating
Then we will surely die
Thereâ€™s no time to be debating
It is written in the skies

Chemtrails in the making
Poison lies
This revolution comes
By each one of us
Walking in our purpose
No need to give up
Keep on pushing forward

Make them fear it
When they hear it
Shine your light
So bright that all see
Never back down
Have your tribe gather round
Lift them up when theyâ€™re stuck

Plant your feet on solid ground
Make the world change
Donâ€™t let complacency win
And never forget that Hawkeye is your friend
