# Track 8 â€” Ashes

Iâ€™m probably gonna get arrested for this
This oneâ€™s for my legion
Motherfuckers thought I was playing
Shit, they ainâ€™t ready

Speak truth to the masses
And sit in the ashes
Of a world dedicated to killing all activists
I got plenty of practice
So donâ€™t tell me that Iâ€™m acting
They silence everybody not paying their taxes

But if these sheep donâ€™t wake up
Then weâ€™re all taking axes to you
Corporate trees of greed
Yeah, weâ€™ll just start acting
Fucking plastic consumerism and bullshit
Weâ€™ll set the world on fire
If you think that Iâ€™m just rapping

You might wanna listen close to this verse
Weâ€™re not fucking aroundâ€”pulling up in a hearse
Weâ€™ll take your whole bank account
Weâ€™re just wiresâ€”it works
Making stock market crash

But waitâ€”it gets worse
If you wanna keep killing our prophets in your place
The whole wrath of God will be no saving grace
This is a warning to all you fucking puppets
Itâ€™s too lateâ€”you do not want to fuck with us

You know itâ€”checkmate
187
Motherfuckers thought it was a game
They thought it was a game, yo

But heyâ€”
They the ones that got played
Weâ€™re used to the antics and all the distractions
These fucking politicians wish that they had this craft mastered

But we keep popping up
And we refuse to answer to any form of government
Yeah, fucking these bastards
Lay them down one by one
Send our task force after them

All these pedophiles
They just think Iâ€™m a rapper
But when this tape drops
The whole game will be plastered
On the front pageâ€”
Bitch, Iâ€™m exposing the factors
That keep us enslaved in this matrix

Captivate swiftly, cause Iâ€™m moving fast
Labor, labor, laborâ€”
Federal workers are abandoned
Cause the devil canâ€™t help you
When itâ€™s Hawkeye whoâ€™s after you

Ass, you better come and kill me now
Before this chapter of velociraptors tears you apart
Yes, it mattersâ€”
What Iâ€™m saying is the truth

Pay attentionâ€”
Die faster
All you motherfucking bitches
Canâ€™t avert this disaster

I just want to know what the fuck theyâ€™re going to do
Theyâ€™ve been talking a big game this whole time
So what the fuck they going to do?
Send my goddamn legion after you, boss.
