# Mic Check

## by Hawk Eye The Rapper
### from the album Full Disclosure

Yeah
Welcome to the mixtape

Mic check one two one two
Let me tell you what Hawkeyeâ€™s bout to do
Gonna lay these tracks into the moon
Iâ€™ma blast off on my Roomba broom
You donâ€™t know it yet but Iâ€™m protecting you
You ainâ€™t sure but I am so see you soon

Cause when I say move the whole world zooms
To make a wave for my tribe or music to boom
You donâ€™t get it yet
Oh well
Too bad you lose
Play the game but donâ€™t let it play you
I got an arsenal of lyrical typhoons
To come and blow you away
Bitch Iâ€™m no fool

Speak Phoenician to these heathens
Fucking preaching as I teach them
Gotta reach beyond these leeches
Pull them out so they can breathe them
Then delete all of these secrets
Keep them
Iâ€™ll drop them so we can let the demons know Iâ€™m back
Trust me they know the reason
They know the reason
Iâ€™m back

Hashtag reincarnated to resist
Come correct
I ainâ€™t bout to lose
Too much sweat so I refuse
To ever let the devil choose to repent
So yeah bitch
Hereâ€™s the noose
Hang yourself up in my web of truth
I know that every backer used some fucking help
So let me sue this
Has to minimize the noose

Blow the little fuckers cover up today
Donâ€™t wait
Thereâ€™s too much at stake
If weâ€™re ever gonna end these foreign wars
We gotta start with the one being waged on us all
Yeah
Itâ€™s in your face
Just like the saw
Mac Spears gave his life but youâ€™re just bored

So let me drop knowledge and keep with the times
Encoded all the triggers to help remind
All of you of the reason why
Your fucking ears perk up when you hear Hawkeye
Yup

Rest in peace to Mac Spears
Like Montana said
Pray for the devil
This is a testament to all those lost
An elegant poet with a sauce
I cook the devil up nice in every song
Make that bitch think twice before he ever crosses my street

I come to keep this creep from influencing all these streets
Leave these sheep with every beat unhypnotized
Iâ€™m too sleek
Witness this
Iâ€™m much too deep to ever let Satan sneak up from behind
Or escape my reach

Strike down from the heavens
Like sons who said
Draw your enemies to you and then leave them dead
All warfare is deception
So I infect each ear that I touch like a viral trend

I ainâ€™t playing bitch
My mission is to change the world
And if Iâ€™ve got a rap I win every award
Just to make sure that my message is heard
I canâ€™t leave this shit to chance
So I put in the work
Yeah
