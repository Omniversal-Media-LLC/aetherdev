# Track 14 - Stay Real

This is an unreal world that we live in
This shit is crazy yo
Stay real
Stay real

Crazy ass world
Stay real man
Whatever
Just remember remember to always

Stay grounded on this shit yeah I kick back and tongue kiss him
With these words upon this page Iâ€™m containing all my rapes
If I come up out this cage then donâ€™t tell him who weâ€™re made
Kill them all with my brain instead of playing in this game

Blue cane Iâ€™m insane ninja flows so they know
Let these nightmares in my head leave them all dead yo
Iâ€™m too peaceful with this evil language
Now Iâ€™m plotting treats and just give me one reason

Iâ€™ll delete them all so season donâ€™t test me
The west be where Iâ€™m about to blow
Do your best chief arrest me cause you already know
I possess keys obsess fiends hack your radios

And I press peeps everywhere riot when I show
Not only ready for it yet but Iâ€™ll keep all of you in check
Have my warriors surround and protect the innocent
If the story and the sound isnâ€™t proof then whatâ€™s next

Unleash my legion on you demons who just thought it was a threat
I am backing in true form playing with the text
Fuck around and let it go bitch Iâ€™m saying cut my check
I could pussyfoot all day but then you would think Iâ€™m playing

Place my feet upon the sacred ground I wish it all away collectively
Infected resurrected with a song
Star tribe on a mission now just listen
Sing along we can end this war today if we wanna bring it on

Too strong our immune system deadly to these germs
But we gotta work together let our gifts flow
Let it let it grow this whole planetâ€™s about to dance
Come on and let it show shine your light so that they know

You canâ€™t stop this revolution noise pollution time to blow
We already won we won the war stay real
These demons donâ€™t want none
Itâ€™s difficult to stay real in such an unreal place

This shit is unreal yâ€™all
Itâ€™s cool hawks here
Hawks here
This generationâ€™s out of patience all you demons ought to know

The wind dark and pleasure major excitation for you hoes
If you want a noose Iâ€™ll make it your defeat was foretold
All my starseeds are planted in god damn it my soul is back up in this matrix
Can I fake it youâ€™ll rule

End it when Iâ€™ve descended yes itâ€™s time to show you fools
Sanctioned with a gratitude system did I mention these jewels that Iâ€™m dropping
They ainâ€™t stopping keep watching as I pour it down
Every foundation that you nations try to lay

Deter race them keep debating hesitating while I play
We are here to heal this planet you ainâ€™t stopping us okay
And I meant it god damn it I planned it this way
And carnated on purpose back again to make a fleet

The dark one circus is just a game to me
Put the servant in the furthest gate take the devil fleet of war
Learning service to the light for all to see
If you want to win this war then a hawkâ€™s your best bet

A true veteran I wrote the book on making them sweat
If the devil gets in the way Iâ€™ll hand him my threat
A whole army couldnâ€™t stop me if they want to conquer it
Iâ€™m commanding every legion that heaven has you dig

And these angels arenâ€™t peaceful so tell all your kids that the boogeyman is back
Run if you want to live every demon that I see is getting sent back to the brink
It is time for the ancient trial to arrive
Every voice all together come on let us shift the tide

The great cycleâ€™s ending new again thereâ€™s no disguise
The children of the sun are awake and alive
